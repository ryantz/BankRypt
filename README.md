Are you using BankRypt? Or are you Bankrupt?

## Tech Stack

Front end: Angular 2
Back end: Java SpringBoot

## Goals

To get more confident with SpringBoot and put in place best practices.
To learn Angular 2 as React is just a tad bit too messy for me.

## Project Roadmap

### Current targets

- [ ] Set up the simple backend with REST apis
- [ ] Add the use of JWT tokens for auth
- [ ] Add hashing of passwords
- [ ] Take time to learn and implement angular 2 for the frontend

### Next steps

- [ ] Make it mobile
